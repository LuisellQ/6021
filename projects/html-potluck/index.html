            There’s a reason I call this the <b>Best Chocolate Cake Recipe:</b>
            it’s so good restaurants have asked
            <br> 
            me to start making it for
            them! This moist and fluffy chocolate cake is going to be your
            go-to
            <br>
            recipe once you try it.

        <h2>The Best Homemade Chocolate Cake</h2>
        <p>
            This is the kind of chocolate cake everyone should have in their
            recipe collection. An easy,
            <br>
            one-bowl cake with the perfect crumb
            that’s covered with a simple homemade chocolate
            <br>
            buttercream
            frosting. This moist cake is made completely from scratch and has
            incredible
            <br>
            chocolate flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
            I literally cannot stop eating this cake whenever I make it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I made this cake for my niece’s birthday last year. When it was
            served, one of the moms asked
            <br>
            my sister-in-law where she’d
            gotten the cake. She pointed at me and the mom came over to ask
            <br>
            me about it. Turns out she has two restaurants in Atlanta and was
            curious if I’d be interested in
            <br>
            making cakes for her restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whaaaaaat?!?
        </p>
        <p>
            Pretty neat, but I actually said no. However,
            <b>this cake is THAT good!</b> Make it and you just
            <br>
            might be
            asked to bake for a restaurant. And whether you want to actually
            do that or not,
            <br>
            don’t you want to be the one with a cake
            that’s so good you could bake for a restaurant?
            <br>
            You know you do.

        <h2>Why You’ll Love This Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            After testing many chocolate cake recipes, this one is hands down
            the best. Here’s why:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>It’s easy to make.</b> Only one bowl!
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Uses simple ingredients.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Has a rich chocolate flavor with a moist, fluffy crumb.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Is covered is an easy chocolate buttercream frosting.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Is drizzled with chocolate ganache.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How is this Recipe Different?</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re familiar with my recipes, then you’ve probably seen
            several variations on chocolate
            <br>
            cake. This is my original
            chocolate cake and is still my favorite to this day. It’s my go-to.
            That
            <br>
            said, I definitely have more than one recipe! Here is
            how they differ:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>My Easy Moist Chocolate Cake Recipe</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Was created after getting quite a few comments from people who
            were confused about the low
            <br>
            baking temperature of this cake. So
            the newer version is baked at 350 degrees, eliminating the
            <br>
            confusion. As a result of the changes made in that recipe, it’s
            not quite as tender as this original
            <br>
            version. But it can be
            handy if you need a more sturdy cake for something you’re
            decorating.
            <br>
            Both of these chocolate cakes use oil, which I
            think works really well in chocolate cake especially.
            <br>
            It adds great moisture.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>My Chocolate Piñata Cake</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Uses butter instead of oil simply because some readers prefer the
            taste of butter and I aim to please!
            <br>
            Plus, as far as sturdiness
            goes, butter based cakes are generally much more sturdy. That’s
            why this
            <br>
            version of chocolate cake holds up much better to
            having holes cut into it and being filled like a piñata. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So to recap, the main difference between this recipe and my others
            is that this one is the
            <br> 
            <b>most tender and moist</b>,it <b>uses oil instead of butter</b>
            and it is <b>baked at a lower temperature</b>
            <br>
            (which means it also
            takes a little longer to bake).

        <h2>How to Make Chocolate Cake</h2>
        <p>
            One thing to note is that this cake has a <b>very thin batter</b>> 
            nd no, it’s not a typo – it’s a slow-bake
            <br>
            cake that bakes at
            <b>300 degrees.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, here’s how you make it:
        </p>
        <h3>Make the Cake</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare your pan & preheat the oven.</b> Prepare three 8
                inch cake pans with parchment paper
                <br>
                circles in the bottom,
                and grease the sides. Preheat oven to 300°F (148°C).
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        >
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Add the wet ingredients.</b>Add eggs, buttermilk and
                vegetable oil to the dry ingredients
                and mix well.
                <br>
                Add vanilla to boiling water and add to
                mixture. Mix well.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        >
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Bake</b> Divide batter evenly between cakes pans and bake
                for 30-33 minutes, or until a toothpick comes
                <br>
                out with a
                few crumbs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Cool </b>Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for about
                10 minutes, then remove to cooling racks to
                <br>
                cool completely.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make the Chocolate Buttercream Frosting</h3>
        <p>
            I usually make the chocolate frosting while the cakes cool.
            Here’s how:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Beat the butter </b>in a stand mixer until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Add the sugar.</b>Slowly add 4 cups (460g) of powdered sugar
                and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Add vanilla and half of the water or milk</b>
                and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>More sugar.</b>Add another 5 cups (575g) of powdered sugar
                and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Mix in the cocoa powder.</b>Add cocoa and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Add remaining water or milk </b>until the frosting is the
                right consistency.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

            alt="layercake"
            width="300"
        >
        <h3>Frost Your Cake</h3>
        <p>
            Once cakes are cool, remove cake domes from top with a large
            serrated knife. See my tips on how to level a
            <br>
            cake and how to
            stack a cake.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Frost the first layer.</b>Place first layer of cake on
                cake plate. Spread about 1 cup of frosting on top in an
                <br>
                even layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Frost the second layer.</b> Add second layer of cake and
                add another cup of frosting on top in an even layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Add more frosting.</b> Frost the outside of the entire cake
                to finish things up.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Make the Chocolate Ganache & Add More Frosting</h3>
        <p>
            Technically you could just stop right here. By this point, you’ll
            have an amazing cake with chocolate buttercream
            <br>
            frosting! But
            if you want to go a bit fancy, this chocolate ganache is an easy
            way to do it.
        </p>

            alt="ganache"
            width="300"
        >
        <h3>To make the chocolate ganache:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Add the chocolate chips to a medium-sized bowl </b>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Heat the heavy whipping cream</b>just until it begins to
                boil, then pour it over the chocolate chips. Allow it
                <br>
                to
                sit or 2-3 minutes, then whisk until smooth.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That’s it. Just two steps!
            <b>Then you add the ganache to your cake:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>
                    Drizzle the chocolate ganache around the edge of the
                    cake,
                </b>
                then pour the remainder of the ganache on top
                <br>
                of
                the cake and spread evenly. I like to use a squeeze bottle 
                or drizzling around the edges.

        <h3>Add Sprinkles and Serve</h3>
        <p>
            Add a few sprinkles to the cake, if desired, then serve. Sprinkles
            are totally optional of course, but why not?

        <h3>How to store a Frosted Cake</h3>
        <p>
            This cake can be stored for 3-4 days on the counter. It should be
            well covered under a cake dome if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also store it in the fridge to extend its shelf life to
            4-5 days, but the frosting will harden. When I store a frosted
            <br>
            cake in the fridge I usually place the cake in the fridge uncovered
            until the frosting hardens (about 2 hours). Then I
            <br>
            cover it with saran wrap.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you are ready to have some cake, simply cut a slice and warm
            it in the microwave (if desired) for about 15-30
            <br>
            seconds. The frosting will soften right up and you’ll have warm
            chocolate cake to enjoy.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Make the Cakes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Prepare three 8 inch cake pans with parchment paper circles in
                the bottom, and grease the sides.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300°F (148°C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add all dry ingredients to a large bowl and whisk
                together.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add eggs, buttermilk and vegetable oil to the dr
                ingredients and mix well.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Add vanilla to hot water and add to mixture. Mix well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Divide batter evenly between cakes pans and bake for 30-33
                minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with a few
                <br>
                crumbs.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Remove cakes from oven and allow to cool for about 10 minutes,
                then remove to cooling racks to cool
                <br>
                completely.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <h4>Makes the Frosting</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Make frosting while cakes cool. Beat the butter in a large
                mixing bowl until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Slowly add 4 cups (460g) of powdered sugar and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add vanilla and half of the water or milk and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add another 5 cups (575g) of powdered sugar and mix until
                smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add cocoa and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add remaining water or milk until the frosting is the
                right consistency.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make the Chocolate Ganache</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To make the chocolate ganache, add the chocolate chips to a
                medium sized bowl
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Heat the heavy whipping cream just until it begins to boil,
                then pour it over the chocolate chips. Allow it to sit
                <br>
                for 2-3 minutes, then whisk until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <h4>Finish Cake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Drizzle the chocolate ganache around the edge of the cake,
                then pour the remainder of the ganache on top of the
                <br>
                cake and spread evenly. I like to use a squeeze bottle for
                drizzling around the edges.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Allow the ganache to firm up a bit, then pipe the remainder
                of the frosting around the top edge of the cake and
                <br>
                pipe a border around the bottom.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Add a few sprinkles to the cake, if desired, then serve. Cake
                is best when well covered for 3-4 days.
            </li>
        </ol>
