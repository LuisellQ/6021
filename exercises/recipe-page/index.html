        </p>
        <h2>MAKING THE CAULIFLOWER</h2>
        <p>
            Start by preheating your oven to 425°F to 450°F depending on your
            oven’s strength. While that’s heating up, get your cauliflower
            ready by cutting it into bite-sized florets. You want them to be
            just the right size so they bake evenly and get nice and crispy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, let’s make the batter. In a mixing bowl, combine buttermilk,
            cornstarch, flour, chili powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt,
            and black pepper. Whisk it all together until you have a thick,
            smooth batter. This is the secret to getting that perfect crunchy
            coating on your cauliflower. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, toss your cauliflower florets into the batter, making sure
            each piece is thoroughly coated. You can either buy a bag of
            cauliflower florets or buy a whole head and chop the florets off
            yourself. Once your florets are coated, add the panko breadcrumbs
            and give everything a good mix. The panko will add an extra layer
            of crunch that takes this dish to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread out the
            cauliflower, making sure the pieces aren’t touching. This ensures
            they bake evenly and get crispy all around. Pop them in the oven
            for about 20 minutes. Take it out of the oven, spray with avocado
            oil, and pop back in the oven for 10 to 15 more minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the cauliflower is baking, it’s time to prepare
            your buffalo sauce. You can use store-bought buffalo sauce or
            make your own if you’re feeling adventurous. My favorite buffalo
            sauces are Sweet Baby Ray’s and Frank’s Red Hot. Once the
            cauliflower is crispy and golden, take it out of the oven,
            transfer it to a bowl, and toss it in the buffalo sauce.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the cauliflower is nicely coated in buffalo sauce, put it
            back on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 to 15
            minutes until golden and crispy. This final bake helps the sauce
            adhere to the cauliflower and ensures every bite is packed with
            flavor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once it’s done, take it out of the oven and sprinkle some chopped
            chives on top for a pop of color and a little extra flavor.
            Serve your buffalo cauliflower with a side of ranch or blue
            cheese dressing for dipping, and enjoy!

        <h4>TIPS AND TRICKS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you’re short on buttermilk, you can make a quick substitut
                by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar to regular
                milk and letting it sit for a few minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make this dish gluten-free, simply swap the all-purpose
                flour for a gluten-free flour blend and use gluten-free panko
                breadcrumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                For a vegan version, use a plant-based milk alternative and a
                vegan buffalo sauce.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>VARIATIONS:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Try different seasonings in the batter, like cumin or smoked
                paprika, to change up the flavor profile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add some grated Parmesan cheese to the panko breadcrumbs for
                a cheesy twist.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you prefer a milder dish, use a less spicy hot sauce or
                dilute your buffalo sauce with a bit of melted butter. You
                could also mix a bit of ranch with buffalo sauce to make it
                more mild and creamy.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This buffalo cauliflower recipe is a versatile and delicious
            dish that’s sure to become a favorite in your household. Whether
