                        Puerto Rico[i] (Spanish for 'rich port'; abbreviated
                        PR),[15] officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
                        [b][j] is a Caribbean island, Commonwealth, and
                        unincorporated territory of the United States. It is
                        located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately
                        1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida,
                        between the Dominican Republic and the U.S. Virgin
                        Islands, and includes the eponymous main island and
                        several smaller islands, such as Mona, Culebra, and
                        Vieques. With roughly 3.2 million residents, it is
                        divided into 78 municipalities, of which the most
                        populous is the capital municipality of San Juan.[15]
                        Spanish and English are the official languages of the
                        executive branch of government,[17] though Spanish
                        predominates.[18] 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of peoples
                        beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago;[19] these included
                        the Ortoiroid, Saladoid, and Taíno. It was then
                        colonized by Spain in 1493 following the arrival of
                        Christopher Columbus.[15] Puerto Rico was contested
                        by other European powers, but remained a Spanish
                        possession for the next four centuries. An influx of
                        African slaves and settlers primarily from the Canary
                        Islands and Andalusia vastly changed the cultural and
                        demographic landscape of the island. Within the Spanish
                        Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic
                        role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New
                        Spain.[20][21] By the late 19th century, a distinct
                        Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around
                        a fusion of indigenous, African, and European elements
                        [22][23] In 1898, following the Spanish–American War,
                        Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States.[15][24]

                        Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and
                        can move freely between the island and the mainland
                        [25] However, Puerto Ricans who do not reside in a U.S.
                        state are disenfranchised from federal elections[26]
                        and generally do not pay federal income tax.[27][28][k]
                        In common with four other territories, Puerto Rico
                        sends a nonvoting representative to the U.S. Congress,
                        called a Resident Commissioner, and participates in
                        presidential primaries; as it is not a state, Puerto
                        Rico does not have a vote in Congress, which governs
                        it under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950.
                        Congress approved a local constitution in 1952,
                        allowing U.S. citizens residing on the island to elect
                        a governor. Puerto Rico's current and future political
                        status has consistently been a matter of significant
                        debate.[29][30]

                    <p>
                        Puerto Rico is Spanish for "rich port".[15] Puerto
                        Ricans often call the island Borinquen, a derivation
                        of Borikén, its indigenous Taíno name, which is
                        popularly said to mean "Land of the Valiant Lord".
                        [33][34][35] The terms boricua, borinqueño, and
                        borincano are commonly used to identify someone of
                        Puerto Rican heritage,[36][37] and derive from Borikén
                        and Borinquen respectively.[38] The island is also
                        popularly known in Spanish as La Isla del Encanto,
                        meaning "the island of enchantment".[39]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor
                        of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was
                        named Ciudad de Puerto Rico ("Rich Port City").[15]
                        Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came
                        to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while
                        San Juan became the name used for the main
                        trading/shipping port and the capital city.[l]

                    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The history of Puerto Rico began with the settlement of
                        the Ortoiroid people before 430 BC. At the time of
                        Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World in
                        1493, the dominant indigenous culture was that of the
                        Taínos. The Taíno people's numbers went dangerously
                        low during the later half of the 16th century because
                        of new infectious diseases carried by Europeans,
                        exploitation by Spanish settlers, and warfare.[51]

                        Located in the northeastern Caribbean, Puerto Rico
                        formed a key part of the Spanish Empire from the
                        early years of the exploration, conquest and
                        colonization of the New World. The island was a
                        major military post during many wars between Spain
                        and other European powers for control of the region
                        in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

                        In 1898, during the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico
                        was invaded and subsequently became a possession of
                        the U.S. The first years of the 20th century were
                        marked by the struggle to obtain greater democratic
                        rights from the U.S.

                        In 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on
                        Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling
                        on the U.S. government to expedite a process that
                        would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully
                        their inalienable right to self-determination and
                        independence.[54] In November 2012, a two-question
                        referendum took place, simultaneous with the general
                        elections.[55][56] The first question, voted on in
                        August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain
                        the current status under the territorial clause of the
                        U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo,
                        effectively approving the second question to be voted
                        on in November. The second question posed three
                        alternate status options: statehood, independence,
                        or free association.[57] 61.16% voted for statehood,
                        33.34% for a sovereign free-associated state, and
                        5.49% for independence.[58][failed verification]

                        Puerto Rico held its statehood referendum during the
                        3 November 2020 general elections; the ballot asked
                        one question: "Should Puerto Rico be admitted
                        immediately into the Union as a State?"
                        The results showed that 52 percent of Puerto Rico
                        voters answered yes.[60]

                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>
                        Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico
                        and various smaller islands, including Vieques,
                        Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these
                        five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited
                        year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in
                        maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year
                        except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of
                        Natural Resources.[61] There are many other even
                        smaller islets, like Monito, located near Mona,[62]
                        and Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both
                        located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only
                        inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and
                        Puerta de Tierra, which are connected to the main
                        island by bridges.[63][64]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The topography of the island is mostly mountainous
                        with large flat areas in the northern and southern
                        coasts. The main mountain range that crosses the
                        island from east to west is called the Cordillera
                        Central (also known as the Central Mountain Range in
                        English). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro
                        de Punta 4,390 feet (1,340 m),[66] is located in this
                        range. Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the
                        highest in the Sierra de Luquillo at the El Yunque
                        National Forest, with an elevation of 3,494 ft
                        (1,065 m).[70]

                    <h3>Climate</h3>
                    <p>
                        Between the dry and wet seasons, there is a temperature
                        change of around 6 °F (3.3 °C). This change is due
                        mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic
                        Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in
                        from the north and northwest. Coastal water
                        temperatures during the year are about 75 °F (24 °C)
                        in February and 85 °F (29 °C) in August. The highest
                        temperature ever recorded was 110 °F (43 °C) at
                        Arecibo,[81] while the lowest temperature ever recorded
                        was 40 °F (4 °C) in the mountains at Adjuntas,
                        Aibonito, and Corozal.[82] The average yearly
                        precipitation is 66 in (1,676 mm).[83]

                    <h3>Hurricanes</h3>
                    <p>
                        Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season,
                        similar to the rest of the Caribbean Sea and North
                        Atlantic Ocean. On average, a quarter of its annual
                        rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which
                        are more prevalent during periods of La Niña than El
                        Niño.[84] A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes
                        near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A
                        hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on
                        average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake
                        Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe
                        Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928
                        is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category
                        5 hurricane.[85]

                    <p>
                        The Puerto Rico Climate Change Council (PRCCC) noted
                        severe changes in seven categories: air temperature,
                        precipitation, extreme weather events, tropical storms
                        and hurricanes, ocean acidification, sea surface
                        temperatures, and sea level rise.[96]
