                    Halloween is the longest “season” of the year at Walt
                    Disney World, beginning in mid-August and running until
                    October 31, 2024. This guide to spook season will cover
                    everything you need to know about how Magic Kingdom, Epcot,
                    Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom, and the resorts
                    celebrate fall–from food to special events, merchandise,
                    and more..
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of basics, we should start by acknowledging the
                    reality that Halloween pales in comparison to Christmas at
                    Walt Disney World. While the Halloween season is
                    technically longer (3 versus 2 months), the holiday
                    season is the biggest in scale and scope. See our Ultimate
                    Guide to Christmas 2024 at Walt Disney World for everything
                    you need to know about that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every park and resort gets into the holiday spirit for
                    Christmas. By contrast, Halloween is largely confined to
                    Magic Kingdom, Disney Springs, and a handful of other
                    locations–and even then, it’s not as ubiquitous as
                    Christmas. Nevertheless, if you’re planning on visiting
                    Florida during the spook season months, we’ve got you
                    covered with everything to make the trip as ghoulish
                    (in a good way!) as possible…

                <p>
                    The crowd levels you’ll encounter at Walt Disney World
                    during Halloween vary widely, which should be unsurprising
                    since it’s a 3-month holiday. Generally speaking, weekends
                    and school breaks are the busiest times to visit Walt
                    Disney World from August through October.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This includes the first half of August, which is still
                    summer vacation for most of the United States. See our
                    August 2024 Crowd Calendar for further insights on good
                    and bad times to visit in that month.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, September is the least busy month at Walt
                    Disney World, making pretty much any day during that month
                    a good time to visit Walt Disney World. However, there are
                    a couple of exceptions towards the beginning and end of
                    the month. See our September 2024 Crowd Calendar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All bets are off in October, which marks the kickoff to
                    Walt Disney World’s 50th Anniversary celebration. While
                    we’re expecting the entirety of the month to have crazy
                    crowds, a recent wave of cancellations might ease
                    attendance levels from crazy to “only” bonkers. See our
                    October 2024 Crowd Calendar for further details.

                    Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party is a hard-ticketed
                    event at Magic Kingdom that allows guests to celebrate the
                    spook season at Walt Disney World. MNSSHP features special
                    entertainment, like Mickey’s Boo to You Halloween Parade,
                    Hocus Pocus Villains Spelltacular stage show,
                    trick-or-treating throughout Magic Kingdom, and the
                    Disney’s Not-So-Spooky Spectacular fireworks show. Lots of
                    characters are out in the park wearing their favorite
                    costumes – and you’re encouraged to wear yours, too!

                <p>
                    Aside from 2020-2021 (when it didn’t happen), we’ve
                    attended Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party at least
                    once every year since 2008–including over a dozen times in
                    2019! You can read about our most recent experience at the
                    event in Mickey’s Scary HOT Halloween Party Report. For
                    what it’s worth, the last two years have been better than
                    2018-2019, so if you haven’t attended since then, it’s
                    potentially worth reconsidering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From all of those party nights–and ticket purchases–we’ve
                    learned a lot about how it works, much of which is also
                    covered in our Guide to Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween
                    Party, which also covers whether it’s worth the money,
                    strategy for the event, and much more.

                    Tickets for most dates of Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween
                    Party will sell out again in 2024, so we’d encourage you to
                    make a decision to attend or not and buy tickets shortly
                    after they go on sale.

                    Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party has been announced in
                    late April during “Halfway to Halloween” in each of the
                    last two years. The three parties before that were
                    announced in mid-February, mid-January, and mid-March,
                    respectively. That’s quite the scattering of months, and
                    it’s honestly difficult to say what’ll happen in 202

                    At Disney’s Hollywood Studios, there’s Halloween fun at
                    Hollywood & Vine where Minnie’s Seasonal Dining is back
                    for Halloween. You can get in the spooky spirit during
                    Minnie’s Halloween Dine.

                    This is once again the normal experience. The buffet
                    recently returned and the full character experience is
                    back. As such, we once again highly recommend Minnie’s
                    Halloween Dine, especially to those who aren’t doing
                    Mickey’s Not So Scary Halloween Party. Read our full
                    Minnie’s Halloween Dine Review for photos of the
                    characters, food, and more!
